## Welcome to Your Tattoo Healing Journey

Congratulations on your new tattoo from NatRezInk! Proper aftercare is crucial to ensure your artwork heals beautifully and maintains its vibrant colors and crisp lines. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to protect your investment and support optimal healing.

## Immediate Aftercare (First 2-3 Hours)

###### Leaving the Studio
- Your artist will cover your fresh tattoo with a protective bandage or wrap.
- Keep this covering on for the time recommended by your tattoo artist (typically 2-4 hours).

## Initial Cleaning and Care (First 2 Weeks)

###### Cleaning Protocol
1. Wash your hands completely before touching your tattoo.
2. Gently clean the tattoo with lukewarm water and a mild, fragrance-free soap.
3. Use your clean fingertips to softly remove any blood, plasma, or excess ink.
4. Pat dry with a clean, soft towel or let air dry.
5. Apply a thin layer of recommended healing ointment.

###### What to Avoid
